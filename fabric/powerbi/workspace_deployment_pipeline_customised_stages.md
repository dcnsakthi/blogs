# Microsoft Fabric (including Power BI) Workspace Deployment Pipeline with Customised Stages

### Deployment Pipelines - Customised Stages 

The pipeline is initially set up with three default stages: Development, Test, and Production. You have the option to either keep these default stages or modify them according to your preferences. You can customize the number of stages and their names within a range of 2-10 stages. To add another stage, click on the "+Add" button. If needed, you can delete stages or rename them by entering a new name in the designated box. Once you have made the desired changes, click on "Create" to finalize the configuration.
